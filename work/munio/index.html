                            <p>Munio is my startup focused on digital driver's licenses. We are building a future that doesn't require physical wallets.</p>
                            <p>At Munio, we believe in the convinence, privacy, and security provided by digital wallets that cannot be replicated by physical wallets. Digital wallets are the future.</p>
                            <p>I along with my team have been working very closely with Apple to build a system that 
                                allows small businesses to verify the age of their customers with the digital IDs that can now be stored in Apple Wallet in 
                                supported states. In my role as Chief Expereince Officer, I work hard to make the process of using a digital ID
                                as painless as possible by working directly with small businesses and their customers to understand their needs.
                                I am also responsible for branding and marketing as well as occasional front-end development. Additionally, manage our relationships 
                                with politicians so we can earn their trust and support.</p>
                            <p>We will soon begin our initial pilot which will be swiftly followed by a large push in Atlanta to get businesses and consumers 
                                to adopt the technology.
                            </p>
